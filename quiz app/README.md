## Description
This is a quiz website built using Javascript
## Installation

The contents of this repository are ready to be hosted or used locally by the user, and the only external requirement is Bootstrap.

## Usage

Upon clicking the start quiz button, a question and four answers are generated. If the correct one is selected, it moves to the next question. If the incorrect one is selected, it reduces the remaining time by 15 seconds. After reaching the end of question 5, the player is prompted to enter their initials and is scored based on time remaining. Upon submission, the player's scores are placed in local storage, so that when the user goes to the high score page, they can see their high score and all other scores. 

## Credits

Styling was made much easier by the wonderful bootstrap documentation available at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) was immensely helpful for learning and understanding JavaScript.

Special thanks to my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
